Artificial intelligence is used to teach machines how to perform tasks like humans which can be
used to automate processes performed by humans. Healthcare sector has a lot of challenges like
rising costs, increasing old population, increased number of infections and shortage of doctors. AI can be used to automate a lot of these tasks which can help solve problems faced by healthcare systems. 

AI has a lot of subfields like computer vision, machine learning and NLP. Different techniques of
AI can be used to automate or train AI models which can perform repetitive tasks by recognizing
patterns in those tasks. Computer vision is used to recognize different types of imaging
modalities in medicine like histological, pathology, Ct scan, X-ray, MRI images. NLP is used to
make chatbots and language models which recognize patterns in text and can help solve medical
cases based on text input.

AI is being used in almost all sectors of healthcare like in history taking, disease diagnosis, drug
discovery, clinical trials, precision medicine, hospital management, decision making and
triage.AI is used by doctors as a tool in disease diagnosis and by patients for patient education
and patient support and in research of drugs, clinical trials and genetic research. AI has a lot of advantages in healthcare, but it also has a lot of challenges in its implementation
like shortage of quality data in healthcare, bias in data and high cost of implanting AI. To make
AI to solve challenges of healthcare, we have to first solve problems in implementation of AI in
healthcare.
