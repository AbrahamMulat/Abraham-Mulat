Music genre classification is a task of classifying a given song to its category or 
genre. It has been a challenging task for years to predict the genre of a music audio 
file to its correct genre. These days through the development of machine learning 
and deep learning algorithm classifying the genre makes it easy. In this project we 
use deep conventional neural network (CNN) and data augmentation to predict the 
genre of a given music. Data augmentation helps to avoid the scarcity of training 
dataset by adding deformations to a collection of annotated training samples which 
results in new additional training data, which helps to improve the performance of 
CNN. 

The second part of this project is music source separation (MSS), which is known 
to be a challenging problem in audio signal processing. MSS is the task of 
decomposing the component sources from a mixture stereophonic music file into 
its vocal and accompaniment part, or more fine-grained, into tracks for vocal, bass, 
drum, and the remaining other instruments or sounds. This task focuses on 
analyzing the existing systems based on neural networks and their performance, in 
addition, it goes deeply into Open-Unmix, a deep neural network implementation 
for music source separation, which is based on a three-layer bidirectional deep 
LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory). The model learns to predict the magnitude 
spectrogram of a target source from the magnitude spectrogram of a mixture input. 
Our main aim is to improve the performance and original work of Open-Unmix for 
music source separation.
