<!-- ![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the TU Berlin.

🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->

Hi 👋, Welcome to my academic research website! I am Abraham Mulat from Ethiopia, an AI researcher and data scientist specializing in computer vision and deep learning. With a strong academic background and hands-on experience in implementing cutting-edge projects, I am passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.

I recently completed my master’s degree and am currently seeking an entry-level or junior position in a forward-moving company where I can apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects in computer vision and data science.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
### Scientific Research and Engineering Training (Internship)
• Implemented a music genre classifier based on Deep learning (CNNs).
• Achieved 92% accuracy on the test dataset.
• Worked on music source separation using open-source software called open-unmix

### Skin diseases detector using Transfer Learning
• Developed a deep learning model using transfer learning method to detect 30 different types of skin diseases, achieving 90 % accuracy on the test dataset.

### Others
Coming soon
